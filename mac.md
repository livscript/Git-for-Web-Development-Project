## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

Git is a version control system.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a set of commands that we use in the terminal and GitHub is a platform for developers to share their code with others.

Git Fetch grabs changes from the remote repository without making any changes to the local files

Git Pull grabs the code from GitHub repository

7. What is a merge conflict?
